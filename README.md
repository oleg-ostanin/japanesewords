WARNING!!!

Don't use the app on your phone!!!

Unless you are really understand what you are doing. 
Never under any circumstances install on your phone apps directly from github. The app might not be dangerous by itself but in order to install it you must turn off security features, and you should never do such a horrible thing. Even on your aunt's old phone there might be some stored passwords.

If you want to fork it and get it production ready and use it as your own - be my guest.

The app helps to memorize japanese words. The interface is simple and pretty straight forward.
